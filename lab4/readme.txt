LAB-4
1.	Write a program to read a string from user and convert it into a list.
2.	WAP to demonstrate how to traverse a list 1) using print(), 2) using while loop and 3) using for loop.
3.	WAP to print only the even numbers present in a List of integers.
4.	WAP to print the List elements using positive and negative indexing.
5.	WAP to print the sum and average of all the elements in a List of numbers.
6.	WAP to demonstrate the use of append(), clear(), copy() and count() methods.
7.	WAP to create two Lists, the first List should contain only even numbers and second List should only contain odd numbers from a single main List of numbers. 
8.	WAP to create a List of numbers from 1 to 100, where each element should be completely divisible by 10. (hint: use comprehension)
9.	WAP to demonstrate the use of sort() of List class, to sort the elements of the List containing Strings based on string length. (Hint: use ‘key’ parameter)
10.	WAP to find the greatest list from the following nested list l1=[[10,20,30],[40,50,60],[70,80,90]]
11.	WAP to create a list whose elements are squares of integers from 1 to 10. 1) Implement without list comprehension and 2) Implement with list comprehension.
12.	WAP to create a list L1 of integers from 1 to 10. From L1 create another list L2 with the condition that at positions having even numbers in L1 that even number will be inserted in L2 else 0 will be inserted. Use list comprehension.
13.	WAP to create a list containing only the String length from each string present in another list of strings. Use list comprehension.
14.	WAP to convert the following string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" into list of words and then create another list that contains uppercase words extracted from the previous list. Create another list that contains sub-list having uppercase words and its length. Use list comprehension.
15.	WAP to remove duplicate elements from a list and create a new list with those unique elements. (Hint: use in and not in )
